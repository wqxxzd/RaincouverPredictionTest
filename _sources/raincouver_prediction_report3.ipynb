    "\n",
    "Our project investigates the prediction of daily precipitation in Vancouver using machine learning methods. Using a dataset spanning from 1990 to 2023, we explored the predictive power of some key environmental and cliamte features such as temperature, wind speed, and evapotranspiration. Our results suggest the best classification model is Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Fuction (SVM RBF) model with the hyperparameter C=10.0. The model achieved a notable F1 score of 0.87 on the positive class (precipitation is present) when generalized to the unseen data, suggesting a high accuracy in precipitation prediction. We also explored feature importance, showing ET₀ reference evapotranspiration and the cosine transformation of months as robust predictors. Hyperparameter optimization did not make improvement to our curren model, indicating the potential need for feature engineering or incoportating more features. Our project presents a reliable model for predicting precipitation with potential practical applications in various fields."

    "# 1. Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction of daily precipitation is a fundamental aspect of meteorological studies {cite:p}`new2001precipitation`. Accurate precipitation prediction is crucial for agriculture, water resources management, as well as daily activities of people. Specifically, in a geographically and climatically diverse region like Vancouver, predicting precipitation is vital for people to prepare for extreme weather events, reducing hazards and minimizing property damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to predict the occurrence of daily precipitation in Vancouver using machine learning (ML) classification methods {cite:p}`ortiz2014accurate`. Specifically, our analysis utilizes a dataset containing daily precipitation information in Vancouver from 1990 to the present (i.e., 6 Nov, 2023). This dataset, sourced from Open-Meteo’s Historical Weather API {cite:p}`Zippenfenig2023open`, includes a number of parameters relevant to precipitation prediction. \n",
    "Key parameters include month, daily temperature measures, wind speeds, wind direction, shortwave radiation, and ET₀ reference evapotranspiration. Specifically, shortwave radiation represents the sum of solar energy received in a day; ET₀ reference evapotranspiration provides an indication of the atmospheric demand for moisture (i.e., higher relative humidity reduces ET₀ ); and month is also included as a variable since it accounts for the seasonal variations in precipitation {cite:p}`pal2000simulation`. This project may contributes insights into accurate forecast of the precipitation in Vancouver."

    "The histograms for temperature variables (maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures at 2 meters above ground, and maximum, minimum, and mean apparent temperatures) generally show a bell-shaped distribution. The histogram for precipitation sums is highly skewed to the right, indicating that there are many days with low precipitation and fewer days with high precipitation. The wind speed and wind gusts also show right-skewed distributions, which is typical for wind speed data, where calm days are more common than extremely windy ones. The dominant wind direction histogram appears to be multimodal. Lastly, the shortwave radiation and the ET₀ Reference Evapotranspiration distribution also appear right-skewed. In summary, the distributions for these climate and environmental features are reasonable and there are no obvious anomalies or outliers that need for further data cleaning."

With the limitation of SVM RBF that it does not inherently provide direct measures of feature importance, we utilized the Logistic Regression analysis previously conducted to derived the relative importance of features based on their fitted coefficients. While the feature importance interpretation may not align precisely with that of the Support Vector Machine, it nonetheless provides valuable insights. Comparsion of features importance are displayed as below ({numref}`Figure {number} <Feature_importance>`). `evapotranspiration` exhibits the highest correlation with precipitation. This correlation aligns intuitively with that increased water evaporation corresponds to an increased likelihood of rainfall. It is observed that `month_cos` shows a strong correlation with existance of rain, whereas such correlation is not evident in the case of `month_sin`. The cosine value of month tends to coincide well with the seasons in Vancouver."

    "\n",
    "The results of this project demonstrate the utility of machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function (SVM RBF), in predicting precipitation in Vancouver. The high F1 score of 0.87 achieved by the optimized SVM model demonstrates the model's good performance in distinguishing between rainy and non-rainy days. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our results show the prominent predictive power of evapotranspiration on precipitation prediction. Furthermore, we showed that the inclusion of month as a circular feature effectively capture seasonal variations, which enhance the model's predictive power. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of improvement from hyperparameter tuning suggests that the default settings of the SVM model could be already near optimal. Future model improvements may not benefit from hyperparameter tuning but rather from exploring additional feature engineering approaches. Next, we can explore regression models for quantitative precipitation prediction. In the meanwhile, examinig potential non-linear relationships between features and precipitation may facilitate further improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our project provides a model that can accurately predict Vancouver's precipitation with a limited number of environemntal and climate features. This is a promising tool and could lead to more powerful precipitation forecasting, with its potential applications in agriculture, urban planning, and disaster preparedness. "
